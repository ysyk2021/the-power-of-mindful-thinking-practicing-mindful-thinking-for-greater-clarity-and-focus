* Free writing: This involves setting a timer and writing continuously without stopping or editing, allowing ideas to flow freely without judgment or self-criticism.

* Mindful walking: This involves taking a walk with the intention of being fully present and engaged in the experience, allowing new ideas to emerge.

This involves cultivating a sense of self-compassion and acceptance, recognizing that creative blocks and failures are a natural part of the creative process. By embracing this mindset, individuals can develop greater resilience and perseverance, and ultimately achieve greater success in their creative endeavors.

By incorporating mindful thinking into their creative practice, individuals can tap into their full creative potential and achieve greater innovation and success in all areas of life.
